/*

    The purpose of this CSS code is to apply smooth scrolling behavior to all elements on the page
    when the user has not specified a preference for reduced motion (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference).
    This can enhance the user experience by providing a smoother scrolling effect for those who have not
    requested reduced motion in their device or browser settings.

/*
    The max() function is used to set the width of the element dynamically.
    It checks the two values provided and selects the largest value as the
    resulting width. In this case, if the viewport width is larger than the
    equivalent of 100 pixels (18vw is greater than 100px), the element's width
    will be determined by the viewport width (18vw). However, if the viewport
    width is smaller than the equivalent of 100 pixels (18vw is less than 100px),
    the element's width will be fixed at 100 pixels.

/*

    The aspect ratio determines the proportional relationship between the width
    and height of the element, ensuring it remains consistent regardless of its
    actual dimensions or the dimensions of its containing block. This can be useful 
    when you want to control the aspect ratio of elements like images or videos, 
    ensuring they maintain a specific width-to-height ratio even as the viewport 
    or container dimensions change.
