}

/*

    The purpose of this CSS code is to apply smooth scrolling behavior to all elements on the page
    when the user has not specified a preference for reduced motion (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference).
    This can enhance the user experience by providing a smoother scrolling effect for those who have not
    requested reduced motion in their device or browser settings.
